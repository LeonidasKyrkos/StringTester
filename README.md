# string-tester

This is a basic string tester application. It currently tests whether a string is or could be palindromic but could be augmented with other tests quite quickly. The form that drives the user interactions can be found in src/components/FormStringTest.vue and the logic that supports it is contained in the src/methods directory and its descendants.
